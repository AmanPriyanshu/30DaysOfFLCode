A community curated and contributed list of helpful resources and materials about _Federated Learning_ and PETs as part of the [`#30DaysOfFLCode`](https://info.openmined.org/30daysofflcode) Challenge by [OpenMined](https://openmined.org).

## `#30DaysOfFLCode` Challenge

**Two main rules**:

1. Study Federated Learning (and/or any other PETs) for _at least_ 1 hour/day for 30 days
2. Share Your Progress Daily by posting on social media using `#30DaysOfFLCode` and engage with other participants.

**Publicly commit to the challenge**: Hold yourself accountable by making a public statement saying you intend to participate in the program

### Articles

* [Beyond Privacy Trade-offs with Structured Transparency](https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.08347) - Structured Transparency: a five-part framework to combine multiple PETs, such as secure computation and federated learning, to maximise their value, and to reduce lingering use-misuse trade-offs in multiple domains.

* [Federated Learning in 10 Lines of Code, with PySyft](https://blog.openmined.org/fl-in-10-lines-of-code-with-pysyft/) - a quick example of how to run a FL experiment using PySyft on medical data.
